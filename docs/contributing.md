# Contributing

If you find an issue, please [open an issue in
GitHub](https://github.com/cellengine/cellengine-python-toolkit/issues). We
welcome PRs, but encourage opening an issue to discuss changes in advance.

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/index.html) for testing, and
[black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code style.

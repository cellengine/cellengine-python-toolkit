# Populations

[CellEngine API: Populations](https://docs.cellengine.com/api/#populations)

A `Population` is largely a wrapper around the CellEngine Population, with
getter and setter methods for writable properties and helper methods. For a
list of accessible properties, see [Properties](#properties).

Methods are available for common access and transformations on the `Population`.

## Properties

CellEngine object. Properties are the snake_case equivalent of those documented on the

# API Client

[CellEngine API](https://docs.cellengine.com/api/)

The CellEngine `APIClient` object is the interface between the CellEngine API
and entities in the Python SDK. You can authenticate easily with the
`APIClient`. Thereafter, you may either use the `APIClient` directly, or you
may operate on the SDK entities. For instance, the following sequences of commands are
equivalent:

```python
import cellengine
client = cellengine.APIClient("username", "password")
exp = client.get_experiment(name="my experiment")
fcsfile = client.get_fcsfile(experiment_id=exp._id, name="my fcs file")
```

```python
import cellengine
client = cellengine.APIClient("username", "password")
exp = cellengine.Experiment.get(name="my experiment")
fcsfile = cellengine.FcsFile.get(experiment_id=exp._id, name="my fcs file")
```

```python
import cellengine
client = cellengine.APIClient("username", "password")
exp = cellengine.Experiment.get(name="my experiment")
fcsfile = exp.get_fcs_file(name="my fcs file")
```

The `APIClient` provides many useful [methods](#methods) for interacting with
CellEngine. It also provides `_get`, `_post`, `_patch`, and `_delete` methods
for batteries-not-included interaction with the [CellEngine
API](https://docs.cellengine.com/api/). If there is a feature you do not see,
please feel free to [make a pull request][contributing] or [create an Issue on

# FcsFiles

[CellEngine API: Fcs Files](https://docs.cellengine.com/api/#fcs-files)

FCS files are the standard data representation for flow cytometry.  In
CellEngine, an `FcsFile` resource represents the file itself, along with
metadata such as the panel and annotations.

For a list of accessible properties, see [Properties](#properties).

Methods are available for common access and transformations on the FCS file.

## Properties
Properties are the snake_case equivalent of those documented on the
[CellEngine API](https://docs.cellengine.com/api/#fcs_files) unless otherwise noted.
